CoopGame is not a coop game due to keyboard hardware limitations that are beyond my control.
CoopGame is a randomly generated platformer where you have to run jump and fight your  way
to the next teleport to progress to the next level.

Instructions are in the game's menu

Folder structure
	Source code is in the folder src
	Assets are in the folder res
	Playable binaries are in the folder bin

I recommend playing the game from one of these sources:
	FlashGame2.html in the bin folder
	CoopGame.swf in the bin folder
